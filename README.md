# dayspring
A Minecraft v1.16.4 modpack built upon the Forge mod loader

A multiMC client container can be found in the repository releases page:

https://github.com/hypernormalisation/dayspring/releases

# Mod list

Mekanism is the provided tech mod, which is very open-ended and can allow for powerful automation.

Transport options are fleshed out with Simple Planes and Waystones. Mekanism also includes a jetpack.

Biome generation is provided by the ever-reliable Biomes O' plenty (BOP). Better Nether/End are incompatible with the Forge mod loader at present.

# Included Resource Packs

The mods supplying the vast majority of new assets, BOP and Mekanism, have Sphax textures included.

32x, 64x, 128x size packs are included for Vanilla, BOP, and Mekanism. 64x is the default, see what performance/appearance balance works for you.

# Included Shader Packs

We package a variety of shader packs:
- BSL - https://bitslablab.com/bslshaders/
- Chocapic 13 - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/chocapic13-shaders
- projectLUMA - https://dedelner.net/projectluma/
- SEUS-Renewed - https://www.sonicether.com/seus/
- Sildurs Vibrant Shaders Lite/Medium/High/Extreme with Volumetric Lighting - https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/
- Wisdom Shaders - https://github.com/bobcao3/Wisdom-Shaders/releases

Sildurs High are recommended.

If your framerate is too low, the more performant shader packs are:
- Sildurs Lite/Medium
- Wisdom

These all have varying flicker effects that might be irritating, but YMMV.

Sildurs and Wisdom can be further configured from within their Shaders Options menu (bottom right button on shader screen). Wisdom in particular has presets from Lite to Ultra within that menu.

# General Performance Tips

Performances are difficult to predict across client machines because Minecraft is a mess.

The default view distance is 16, which should yield playable framerates on most machines with 64x textures and Sildurs high shaders.

If this is too much for your GPU, try downgrading the textures to their 32x variants (ignore compatibility warnings) and try a more performant shader pack.

The view distance can be further decreased, but anything below 12 might be slightly claustrophobic. You can, however, expect possibly the largest performance gains with this tweak.
